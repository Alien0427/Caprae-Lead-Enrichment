### 🔑 Core Capabilities
1. **Company Discovery** – Uses Google CSE & Bright Data to find target companies by *industry* & *location*.
2. **Data Enrichment** – Firecrawl, HubSpot, Proxycurl, and Bright Data APIs extract employee size, revenue, HQ, funding stage, etc.
3. **LLM Insights** – Gemini Pro scores each lead (Green/Yellow/Red) and estimates Buy-Intent (High/Medium/Low) with rationale.
4. **Contact Extraction** – Regex + scraping parses emails & phone numbers from web snippets.
5. **Visual Analytics** – Interactive Streamlit charts: score breakdown, industry histograms, missing-data pie, and more.
6. **Sales Playbook Generator** – One-click Gemini prompt returns custom pitch, icebreaker, objections, and ideal contact timing.
7. **Exports** – Download as CSV or push directly to Google Sheets.
